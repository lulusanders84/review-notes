Ultrasound Accelerated Fracture Healing Device
Description
Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) has been investigated as a technique to accelerate healing of fresh fractures, 
surgically treated closed fractures, delayed unions, nonunions, stress fractures, osteotomy sites, and distraction 
osteogenesis. LIPUS is administered using a transducer applied to the skin surface overlying the fracture site.
 FDA REGULATORY STATUS                                                                                                  
             
In 1994, the Sonic Accelerated Fracture Healing System (SAFHSÂ®; renamed Exogen 2000Â® and since 2006, Exogen 4000+; 
Bioventus) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration through the premarket approval process for treatment 
of fresh, closed, posteriorly displaced distal radius (Colles) fractures and fresh, closed, or grade I open tibial 
diaphysis fractures in skeletally mature individuals when these fractures are orthopedically managed by closed 
reduction and cast immobilization. In February 2000, the labeled indication was expanded to include the treatment of 
established nonunions, excluding skull and vertebra. Food and Drug Administration product code: LPQ.
 POLICY STATEMENT                                                                                                       
                     
Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound may be considered not medically necessary as a treatment of fresh fractures (surgically 
managed or nonsurgically managed).
Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound may be considered not medically necessary as a treatment of fracture nonunion and 
delayed union fractures.
Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound may be considered not medically necessary as a treatment of stress fractures, 
osteotomy, and distraction osteogenesis.
 POLICY GUIDELINES                                                                                                      
                      
FRESH (ACUTE) FRACTURE
There is no standard definition for a âfreshâ fracture. A fracture is most commonly defined as fresh for 7 days after 
the fracture occurs (Heckman et al, 1994; Kristiansen et al, 1997; Emami et al, 1999), but there is definitional 
variability. For example, 1 study defined fresh as less than 5 days after fracture (eg, Lubbert et al, 2008), while 
another defined fresh as up to 10 days postfracture (Mayr et al. [Does low intensity,

pulsed ultrasound speed healing of scaphoid fractures?] [German]. Handchir Mikrochir Plast Chir. Mar 
2000;32(2):115-122). Most fresh closed fractures heal without complications using of standard fracture care (ie, closed 
reduction and cast immobilization).

NONUNION
There is no consensus on the definition of nonunions. One definition is a failure of progression of fracture healing 
for at least 3 consecutive months (and at least 6 months postfracture) accompanied by clinical symptoms of 
delayed/nonunion (pain, difficulty weight bearing; Buza & Einhorn, 2016).
The definition of nonunion used in U.S. Food and Drug Administration labeling suggests that nonunion is considered 
established when the fracture site shows no visibly progressive signs of healing, without providing guidance on the 
timeframe of observation. The following patient selection criteria are consistent with those proposed for electrical 
stimulation as a treatment of nonunions (see evidence review 7.01.07):
â¢     At least 3 months have passed since the date of the fracture, and
â¢     serial radiographs have confirmed that no progressive signs of healing have occurred, and
â¢     the fracture gap is 1 cm or less, and
â¢     the patient can be adequately immobilized and, based on age, is likely to comply with nonweight bearing.

DELAYED UNION
Delayed union is defined as a decelerating healing process as determined by serial radiographs, together with a lack of 
clinical and radiologic evidence of union, bony continuity, or bone reaction at the fracture site for no less than 3 
months from the index injury or the most recent intervention.
 BENEFIT APPLICATION                                                                                                    
                    
Experimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion 
Section of brochure).

Summary of Evidence
For individuals who have fresh fractures (surgically or nonsurgically managed) who receive LIPUS as an adjunct to 
routine care, the evidence includes RCTs and several meta-analyses. Relevant outcomes are symptoms, morbid events, 
functional outcomes, and quality of life. The evidence base has recently evolved with the publication of a large RCT 
and meta-analysis significantly shifting the weight of the evidence. Conclusions based on several earlier and small 
RCTs, rated at high risk of bias, showed a potential benefit of LIPUS; however, the large RCT published in 2016, rated 
at low risk of bias, showed no benefit. A 2017 meta-analysis including only trials with low risk of bias found no 
difference in days to full weight bearing, pain reduction, or days to radiographic healing. Similarly, the overall 
results of the meta- analysis found no significant difference in return to work, subsequent operations, or adverse 
events. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes.
For individuals who have fracture nonunion or delayed union fracture who receive LIPUS as an adjunct to routine care 
including surgery, if appropriate, the evidence includes only lower quality studies consisting  of a small systematic 
review in scaphoid nonunions, a meta-analysis of nonunion in various locations, 3 low-quality RCTs, and observational 
studies. Relevant outcomes are symptoms, morbid events, functional outcomes, and quality of life. Reported outcomes in 
this subgroup of fractures do not include functional outcomes. A wide range of healing rates has been reported across 
the observational studies with a lack  of comparison with routine surgical care, limiting any meaningful interpretation 
of these results.
Additionally, the evidence base on the use of LIPUS in the management of fresh fractures has evolved as described 
above, and there is no demonstrated physiologic mechanism suggesting differential results of

For individuals who have stress fractures, osteotomy sites, or distraction osteogenesis who receive  LIPUS as an 
adjunct to routine care, the evidence includes only lower quality studies consisting of small RCTs. Relevant outcomes 
are symptoms, morbid events, functional outcomes, and quality of life. Results do not generally include functional 
outcomes and results across various outcomes, primarily time to radiographic healing, are inconsistent. Additionally, 
the evidence base on the use of LIPUS in the management of fresh fractures has evolved as described above and there is 
no demonstrated physiologic mechanism suggesting differential results of LIPUS in stress fractures, osteotomy sites, or 
distraction osteogenesis. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes.

Practice Guidelines and Position Statements
British Medical Journal Rapid Recommendation
The British Medical Journal (BMJ) Rapid Recommendations are a series of articles, produced by BMJ in collaboration with 
the MAGIC group,29 to provide clinicians with practice guidelines. In 2017, BMJ Rapid Recommendations published 
guidelines on the use of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) for bone healing.30 The guidelines were based on a 
2017 systematic review, which included 26 randomized controlled trials evaluating patients with fresh fractures not 
surgically managed, fresh fractures surgically managed, nonunion fractures, osteotomy, and distraction osteogenesis.3 
The committee concluded that there is âmoderate to high certainty evidence to support a strong recommendation against 
the use of LIPUS for bone healing.â Furthermore, the guideline expert panel discussed whether the results of higher 
quality studies in patients with fresh fractures reported in Schandelmaier et al (2017) would apply to other types of 
fractures including nonunions and osteotomies.3 âAfter extensive deliberations, the panel found no compelling 
anatomical or physiological reasons why LIPUS would probably be beneficial in these other patient populations.â30
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidance (2010) on LIPUS to promote fracture 
healing.31 NICE concluded that this procedure âcan reduce fracture healingâ and is particularly beneficial for âdelayed 
healing and fracture non-union.â
NICE published guidance (2013) on Exogen for the treatment of long-bone fractures with nonunion and delayed fracture 
healing.32 NICE concluded that use of the Exogen bone healing system to treat long- bone fractures with nonunion is 
supported by âclinical evidenceâ and âcost savings â¦ through avoiding surgery.â For long-bone fractures with delayed 
healing, defined as no radiologic evidence of healing after 3 months, there was âsome radiologic evidence of improved 
healing.â However, due to âsubstantial uncertainties about the rate at which bone healing progresses without adjunctive 
treatment between 3 and 9 months after fractureâ and need for surgery, âcost consequencesâ were uncertain. The next 
review of this guidance is in 2018.

American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons
The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2009) published guidelines on the treatment of distal radius fractures.33 
The Academy issued a limited recommendation for the use of LIPUS for adjuvant treatment of distal radius fractures. 
While evidence from 1 study demonstrated an increased rate of healing (measured by the absence of pain and radiographic 
union), the additional cost of LIPUS resulted in a âlimitedâ recommendation.
